# Exoplanet Identification - A Comprehensive ML-based Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a comprehensive machine learning-based analysis for exoplanet identification. Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. The goal of this project is to develop and compare different machine learning models for the identification of exoplanets using the provided dataset.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- catboost

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the cumulative.csv file. It contains various features related to stars and their potential exoplanets. These features will be used as input variables for our machine learning models.

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umairrrkhan/Exoplanet Identification A Comprehensive ML-based Analysis.ipynb.git
```

## Models

We have implemented and compared the performance of the following machine learning models for exoplanet identification:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- LightGBM Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier

## Results

The results of the model comparison and performance evaluation are available in the results.txt file. We provide accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and other relevant metrics for each model tested.
